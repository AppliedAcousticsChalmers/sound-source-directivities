# Some Notes on the Data in this Folder

This folder contains a selection of directivity data of musical instruments. The directivity of musical instruments depends on many factors including the played pitch, fingering, articulation, and playing effort. Some databases such as the [TUB-RWTH database](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-5861.2) provide quite a selection for some of the parameters, which produces gigabytes of data. We prefer not to process and upload all such data here before knowing that there is someone who actually wants to use them. 

We provide for now only a complete dataset for the [oboe](oboe_modern_TUB_RWTH) in the case of the TUB-RWTH database. We provide a set of sample data for some of the other instruments so that you can take a peek into them. The AAL datasets are complete for those instruments that we provide. There are more instruments in the set. 

[Contact us](http://www.ta.chalmers.se/people/jens-ahrens/) if you need a complete set of tones for a given instrument, and we'll prepare it for you. This will be quick as all processing is in place. We literally only need to press the button. Make sure that you browse the documentation of the original resources to be aware of all data that are available.
