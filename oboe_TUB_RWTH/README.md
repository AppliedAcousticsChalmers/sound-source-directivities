The data are taken from the measurements of 41 musical instruments in the [database by TUB and RWTH](http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-5861.2 ). The instrument as well as the steadily played note based on which the directivity was computed can be deduced from the file names. The oboe playing c5 is featured in this article:
